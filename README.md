# Infernommatic

This script was developed to address a problem at the SetuLab (University of Paulo), in which reads were still contaminated with adapters even after running multiple read trimming tools. This might be due to wetlab problems.  
Here we try to remove those fragmented adapters from many positions in the read sequence!   

## Installation

pip install git+https://github.com/FefoRossi/Infernommatic
